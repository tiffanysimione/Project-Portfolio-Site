Challenges/ Thinks to work on:
-I had a hard time staying organized
- re why my css is all over the place
-I did not plan out what I wanted in detail which let to messy and not dry code
-I struggled getting the layout I wanted initally on smaller screens which resulted in me needing to chane my layout
-I would like to make a different looking carsoul but I need to brush up on my jquery for that


3 points of functionality: Please see the sources above that allowed me to create some of these functionalities 
I did not copy any code , but they were used as a reference to guide me in building them. 
1.The Hamburger Icon
This code adds a clickable button (the "hamburger" element) that toggles the visibility of a menu when clicked.


2.The Carousel
Was made referencing the corgi lab:

3.Dark mode
This code creates a button  "switch" element) that toggles the appearance of the webpage between  light mode and a dark mode when clicked.
The code adds two event listeners. One listener is added to an element with the class .switch, and the other listener is added to an element with the class .switch2.
